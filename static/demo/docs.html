      Plasmid uses group based access control. You can create groups, subscribe to groups, and give read/write permissions to any user or group for each page you make. Plamid takes care of user authentication and access control.

      Plasmid allows you to embed many types of widgets into the pages, including comments, rating, audio/video players. It also allows you to include LaTeX formulas.
